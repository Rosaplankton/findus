### Backround

Physarum polycephalum, also known as slime molds, belongs to the supergroup Amoebozoa, phylum Mycetozoa, and class Myxogastria. Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that inhabits shady, cool, moist areas, such as decaying leaves and logs. It is sensitive to light; in particular, light can repel the slime mold and be a factor in triggering spore growth.
Slime mold is one example of an emergent self-organizing complex adaptive system.
It grows into an interconnected network of protoplasmic strands.
Feeding on fungi and bacteria it moves like a giant amoeba. When conditions such as light, temperature and moisture change,
the slime molds cells will join up to form a mass that that spreads to a more favorable location.

### Findus the hungry slime mold

In this project we want to explore, if we can manipulate the slime molds growth.
We know, that the slime mold will spread to find new food. It never takes the same way twice, so it is somehow able
to remember where it has already been.
In our setup, we assume, that the hungry slime mold will follow the offered food.
